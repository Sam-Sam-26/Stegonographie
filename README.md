# Stegonography
> This projet is not over.  
> Feel free to give me suggestions and contribute.
## Description
This projet is currently not really complicated, the programs takes the pixel value in ARGB and puts every value in binary (8 bits). It then hides a message also converted in binary in the end of each byte adding 8bits of '0' to show it is the end of the message.
## Improvements
* End translating it to english, I originately built it in french / english.
* Add method to hide the message better in the image (for exemple by jumping 2 pixels one time on 3).
## Functionnalities
* Hide a message in the image.
* Check if the image actually has a message in it.
* Get the hidden message from the image and display it.
